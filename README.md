# A Marketplace for Open Science Project: XYZsat (Space Direction Monitor)

## Project Overview

XYZsat is a cube-shaped satellite measuring 10cm on all sides, designed to monitor various space-related parameters, including X, Y, Z acceleration, angular and linear velocity, orientation, Earth gravitational force, mass, speed, and the position of X, Y, Z directions using a single sensor. This marketplace project aims to foster collaboration and innovation in the field of open science by connecting project creators and collaborators interested in the XYZsat technology.

## Objectives

- Create a platform that allows project creators to showcase their XYZsat projects.
- Enable potential collaborators, especially students interested in space exploration, to discover and contribute to XYZsat projects.
- Promote open science principles and inspire students to engage in space technology research.

## Components

- XYZsat cubesat technology.
- Microcontroller-based sensor data collection.
- SD card storage for sensor data.
- A marketplace platform hosted on GitHub.

## Future Work

The future work for this project includes implementing supercapacitor technology to improve energy efficiency, reduce environmental impact, and extend the lifecycle of XYZsat devices. We also plan to expand the marketplace to include more open science projects that can benefit students and the broader scientific community.

## Conclusion

The "A Marketplace for Open Science Project: XYZsat (Space Direction Monitor)" project aims to create a collaborative environment where space enthusiasts, researchers, and students can connect and contribute to innovative open science projects. By sharing this project on GitHub, we hope to inspire future generations to explore space technology and contribute to the development of sustainable and environmentally friendly solutions.
